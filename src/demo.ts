/**
 * Demo: sign one fixed request with a freshly generated ed25519 key,
 * print the wire headers, verify it, then tamper the body by one byte
 * and show the verifier rejecting it. After that single-signature
 * script, the demo runs the canonical multi-party payments flow: the
 * payment gateway appends a second signature with `addSignature`
 * (label `gateway`, hmac-sha256), the merged wire headers are printed,
 * and `verifyAllLabels` verifies each label independently. Finally the
 * demo tampers `content-type` — a component only the gateway signature
 * covers — to show one label failing while the other still verifies.
 * The next segment demonstrates nonce replay protection: the demo
 * signs in with an opt-in `ReplayCache`, so the *same* signed request
 * verifies once and is then rejected with `NONCE_REPLAY`, while a
 * request carrying a different nonce still verifies. The next segment
 * re-signs the same request with `contentDigestAlg: "sha-256"` for a
 * peer that only accepts sha-256 digests: its `content-digest` header
 * and verification are printed alongside the main line's sha-512
 * header, and a one-byte body tamper is rejected with
 * `BODY_DIGEST_MISMATCH`. The closing segment demonstrates JWKS key
 * resolution: a `JwksKeyStore` is
 * restored offline from a snapshot of the demo public key, the demo
 * request verifies through its key resolver, and a request signed
 * under an unknown `keyid` is rejected with `KEY_RESOLUTION_FAILED`.
 *
 * Usage: `npm run demo` (builds with tsc, then runs node on the compiled
 * output). Zero runtime dependencies: this file only imports the library
 * itself.
 *
 * The request data is deterministic — fixed method, URL, body, `created`
 * timestamp, key id, and nonce are constants below; no wall clock beyond
 * the injected verify instant, no network. The ed25519 key pair itself
 * is generated fresh on every run (see `generateEd25519KeyPair`), so the
 * signature bytes differ between runs while every other printed line is
 * identical. The gateway HMAC secret below is a fixed demo value (never
 * use it anywhere else), so the gateway signature itself is
 * deterministic; only the merchant's fresh-key signature varies.
